# Health_Related_Data

I'm interested in telemedicine, health-related datasets, wearable technologies and edge technology. 
So I'm creating files that related to these topics.

The first set of files are from a dataset that was collected in 2014 when 9 diabetic people were wearing a continuous glucose monitor (CGM). These monitors meausure a person's glucose levels every 5 minutes.

The data was collected as a part of another study, and it is a bit old - it's from 2014. But it's freely available here https://zenodo.org/record/5651217#.YbOKor3MKUk along with some other data that includes when the participants documented eating, the food they ate, and the insulin they gave themselves.

I've created some Excel files from each of the patients that I"m uploading here. I want to see how the readings compare over a 24 hour timeframe.
